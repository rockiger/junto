                Your wiki made for Google Keep™ is too simplistic? Google Docs™

            </p>
            <p>
                Then Fulcrum is for you!
            </p>

                Disclaimer: We are still in beta.

            <h2>Why Fulcrum?</h2>
            <p>
                When we started with G Suite we were looking for a solution to
                create our knowledge base. We first tested Keep. Though it's
                great for taking notes, it's much too simplistic to create
                compelling documentation for your work.
            </p>
            <p>
                We then switched to Docs - which is a great word processor!
                Maybe the best we ever used. For reading and finding information
                on the other hand it is a real pain. It's very cumbersome to
                create an information structure with Docs and the loading of
                documents takes ages if you just want to look up something. It
                is made for writing, not reading.
            </p>
            <p>
                After this experience we started to build Fulcrum. It fits right
                in there. It is the missing link between Keep and Docs. Create
                powerful documentation right in your personal Google Drive or
                collaborate with your team on a shared Drive.
            </p>
            <h2>Build great looking pages - all saved in your Google Drive</h2>
            <p>
                Create pages with all content formats you need. Tables, Images,
                Lists - you name it. Write a new marketing plan, document your
                workflow for employee onboarding or write a memo for your
                co-workers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best is: Everything stays on your Drives. Unlike other
                tools, we don't introduce a new SaaS infrastructure to your
                business. All the content you create is saved on your Drives.
                Nothing is saved on our servers.
            </p>
            <h2>Easily find & navigate your work</h2>
            <p>
                Always stay on top of your work. Organize your work in different
                Drives and create sub-pages of your work. Access your most
                recent and important work instantly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't waste your time with searching. Find what you are looking
                for with a powerful search - just like you expect from any other
                Google product.
            </p>
            <h2>Work seamlessly with your G Suite</h2>
            <p>
                Fulcrum allows you to connect your pages with other G Suite
                applications. Insert your photos into your pages. Open
                documents, presentation and spreadsheets directly from your
                pages. Share them with your co-workers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything is tightly integrated. We even stick to Google's
                design guidelines that you and your team-mates are productive
                instantly.
